              <p> B) The User permits the Operator to use the submitted contents in order to provide the services related to this Website and grants the Operator all necessary rights for the contents free of charge.

              <p> C) Since this website is a public and open community, the Users agree expressly to their contents being linked (reference or integration on external internet sites) by a third party. Also the purpose of the community stipulates that all contents shall be freely available for a third party and particularly can be used by a third party for its own purposes. The Users grant the Operator the right to sub-license and transmit the granted rights, respectively the related contents. The Operator does not claim ownership of these contents.

              <p> G) The Operator allows the User to use the services provided on the Operator’s website during the User’s membership, and therefore grants the User single and non-transferable usage rights. </p>
              <p> 7. Availability of Services </p>
              <p> A) The User acknowledges that the Operator does not provide any warranty or guarantee for the availability of his website or the content submitted to it.

              <p> If you feel, any contents submitted to this website by Users are in violation of the website’s usage terms or legal regulations, we ask you to get in contact with us by either using the address listed on this website’s contact page and providing us with the exact location (category…) of the specific content(s) or by using the “report this item” function, located underneath the medium’s display window. </p>
              <p> 10. Intellectual Property of Operator </p>

              <p> A) These usage conditions and the entire legal relation between the Operator and the Users are subjected to the jurisdiction of the Federal Republic of Germany, under exclusion of the UN-Purchasing Regulations.

              <p> B) In case any part of these terms is not valid, this does not affect the other (remaining) parts of these terms. Ineffective, invalid or futile regulations (if any) will be replaced by such regulations, which's meaning and contents are similar the most to the economical intentions of the original ones; the same applies to possible gaps of these terms (if any).
